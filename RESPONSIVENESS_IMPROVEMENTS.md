## Responsive Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Mobile-First Approach
- All components start with mobile styles and scale up
- `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` breakpoints used consistently
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px touch targets)

### 2. Flexible Layouts
- `flex-col sm:flex-row` for responsive direction changes
- `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` for responsive grids
- `w-full sm:w-auto` for responsive widths

### 3. Typography Scaling
- `text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl` for responsive text sizes
- Consistent scaling across all components

### 4. Spacing Optimization
- `p-4 sm:p-6` for responsive padding
- `gap-4 sm:gap-6` for responsive gaps
- `space-y-4 sm:space-y-6` for responsive vertical spacing

### 5. Table Responsiveness
- Hidden columns on mobile: `hidden sm:table-cell`
- Responsive padding: `px-3 sm:px-6`
- Mobile card views for complex tables

### 6. Form Optimization
- Single column on mobile, multi-column on larger screens
- Full-width buttons on mobile: `w-full sm:w-auto`
- Responsive input sizing

### 7. Modal Improvements
- Mobile-friendly modals with proper padding
- Scrollable content: `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`
- Responsive modal sizing

## Breakpoint Strategy

### Large (lg: 1024px+)
